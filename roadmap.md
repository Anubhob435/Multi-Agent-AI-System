# Multi-Agent AI System Roadmap

## Goal
Build a multi-agent AI system that:

- Accepts a natural-language goal
- Uses agents (modular code units) that depend on each other
- Plans and routes data from agent to agent
- Refines the result iteratively until the goal is satisfied
- Uses Google ADK (Assumed as an Android-based hardware interface or SDK-like agent wrapper)
- Uses 2â€“3 public APIs for enrichment (e.g., SpaceX, OpenWeatherMap, NewsAPI)

## Roadmap: What To Do Step-by-Step

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup

1. **Define the system goal** â€“ e.g., "Find the next SpaceX launch, check weather, analyze delay chances."

2. **Decide the agents:**
    - **Planner Agent** â€“ Takes user goal, plans agent sequence
    - **Launch Info Agent** â€“ Gets SpaceX data
    - **Weather Agent** â€“ Uses location from previous to get weather
    - **Summary Agent** â€“ Determines delay possibility

3. **Create a project folder structure:**
    ```
    multi-agent-system/
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ agents/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ planner.py
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ spacex_agent.py
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ weather_agent.py
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ summary_agent.py
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ .env
    â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ evals/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_goals.json
    â””â”€â”€ docs/
        â”œâ”€â”€ flow_diagram.png
        â””â”€â”€ agent_logic.md
    ```

### Phase 2: Coding the Agents

- **Planner Agent:**  
  NLP-based or keyword-based goal parsing.  
  Maps task to sequence: e.g., [SpaceX â†’ Weather â†’ Summary]

- **SpaceX Agent:**  
  Calls SpaceX API â†’ Gets next launch info (location, time).

- **Weather Agent:**  
  Uses OpenWeatherMap API â†’ Uses launch site coordinates.

- **Summary Agent:**  
  Evaluates wind, cloud cover, etc. â†’ Summarizes delay risk.

### Phase 3: Enrichment and Routing

- Each agent takes previous output as input.
- Ensure response objects pass essential data forward.
- Track agent logs or JSON messages between agents.

### Phase 4: Evaluation & Testing

- Create goal prompts (e.g., in `evals/test_goals.json`).
- Simulate:
    - Success on 1st pass
    - Failure â†’ retry route â†’ goal satisfied
- Log agent interactions for review.

### Phase 5: Documentation

- Diagram the flow.
- Document agent behavior.
- Add API usage instructions.
- Write a clear README.
