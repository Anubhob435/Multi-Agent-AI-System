# ðŸ§®ðŸ“– New Agent Integration - Calculator & Dictionary

## âœ… Successfully Added

### ðŸ§® Calculator Agent (`calculator_agent.py`)
**Purpose**: Performs mathematical calculations and solves equations

**Trigger Words**: `calculate`, `compute`, `solve`, `math`, `equation`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`

**Capabilities**:
- Basic arithmetic: `2 + 3`, `10 * 5`, `100 / 4`
- Square roots: `square root of 144`, `sqrt(16)`
- Powers: `2 to the power of 8`, `3^4`, `2**5`
- Trigonometric functions: `sin of 30`, `cos(60)`, `tan(45)`
- Logarithms: `log of 100`, `logarithm of 1000`
- Complex expressions: `(2 + 3) * 4`, `sqrt(16) + 2^3`

**Examples**:
```bash
# Through main workflow
echo "calculate the square root of 144" | python main.py
echo "compute 15 * 8" | python main.py
echo "solve 2^8" | python main.py

# Through quick test
echo "5" | python quick_agent_test.py  # Then enter calculation
```

### ðŸ“– Dictionary Agent (`dictionary_agent.py`) 
**Purpose**: Provides word definitions, meanings, and synonyms

**Trigger Words**: `define`, `definition`, `meaning`, `what is`, `what does`, `dictionary`

**Capabilities**:
- Word definitions with multiple meanings
- Part of speech identification (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
- Phonetic pronunciations
- Usage examples
- Synonyms and antonyms
- Etymology and word origins

**Examples**:
```bash
# Through main workflow
echo "define serendipity" | python main.py
echo "what is the meaning of algorithm" | python main.py
echo "dictionary definition of programming" | python main.py

# Through quick test
echo "6" | python quick_agent_test.py  # Then enter word
```

## ðŸ”§ Integration Details

### âœ… Updated Components

1. **Google ADK Agent** (`google_adk_agent.py`)
   - Added calculator_agent and dictionary_agent to valid agents list
   - Enhanced trigger word detection in fallback logic
   - Updated AI planning prompts to include new agents

2. **Main Workflow** (`main.py`)
   - Added new agents to valid agents list
   - Enhanced agent selection prompt for Gemini
   - Added output formatting for calculator and dictionary results
   - Updated agent execution logic

3. **Quick Agent Test** (`quick_agent_test.py`)
   - Added options 5 and 6 for new agents
   - Created interactive test cases for both agents
   - Updated test_all_agents function to include new agents
   - Enhanced menu system (now 0-6 instead of 0-4)

### âœ… Agent Selection Logic

The system now intelligently selects agents based on trigger words:

**Calculator Agent Selected When**:
- User mentions: calculate, compute, solve, math, equation
- Mathematical symbols present: +, -, *, /, =, ^
- Mathematical functions: sqrt, sin, cos, log, power

**Dictionary Agent Selected When**:
- User mentions: define, definition, meaning, dictionary
- Phrases like: "what is", "what does", "what means"
- Context indicates word lookup needed

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

### All Agents Working âœ…
```
ðŸ“Š Results: 6/6 agents working
âœ… SpaceX: OK
âœ… Weather: OK  
âœ… Calculator: OK
âœ… Dictionary: OK
âœ… Summary: OK
âœ… Google ADK: OK
```

### Example Workflows Tested âœ…
1. **"calculate the square root of 144"**
   - Gemini correctly selects: calculator_agent â†’ summary_agent
   - Calculator finds expression: sqrt(144)
   - Result: 12.0
   - Summary provides helpful context

2. **"define serendipity"**
   - Gemini correctly selects: dictionary_agent â†’ summary_agent
   - Dictionary finds comprehensive definition
   - Result: Full definition with pronunciation and examples
   - Summary provides additional context
